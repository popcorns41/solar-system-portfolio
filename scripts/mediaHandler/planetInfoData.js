      "The Step Programme (<a href='https://www.iomdfenterprise.im/enterprise-support/all-schemes/step-programme/' target='_blank'>Listed here</a>) is an eight-week paid placement scheme, organised by the Isle of Man Department for Enterprise, designed for university undergraduates—typically in their second or penultimate year. Students partner with local host organisations over the summer to complete meaningful, project-based work, benefiting from both professional development and a Living Wage stipend. In addition to valuable on-the-job learning and potential job opportunities, the programme culminates in a final event where participants submit a project report and deliver a presentation to a panel of judges. Winners earn awards based on the quality of their work and presentations. The Step Programme assigned me to Salex LTD based in Castletown, Isle of Man, my work earned the award for best presentation (shown:<a href='#image2'>here</a>)",
      "Salex LTD (<a href='https://www.salexltd.com/' target='_blank'>listed here</a>)  handles West African commodity trading across regions from Tanzania to Zimbabwe. The organisation and its sister companies previously relied on a legacy process involving Excel spreadsheets and phone calls to track logistics, a system that was error-prone and inefficient. To modernise operations, a web application called FUATA was developed as a centralised platform for managing all shipments handled by Salex LTD.",
      "During my 2023 summer internship, my contributions included: Leading user training sessions to onboard staff onto the new system. Designing wireframes for key modules based on user and stakeholder needs, and engineering automated file workflows using Microsoft Power Automate.",
      "This experience marked my first exposure to software maintenance, including attending developer meetings, engaging with ticket-based workflows, and aligning my deliverables with developer sprint cycles."],

      "Working with the University of Edinburgh's maker space and a strong team of peers, we built a robot that plays pool on a half-scale table. The semester-long project combined several engineering disciplines. We divided the robot's systems into key modules: electrical, robotic, computer vision and camera (see<a href='#image2'>Image 2</a>), structural support, and a mobile web app for user input. In a typical use case, the web app shows a real-time view of the pool balls and prompts the user—via a mobile game-style UI—to take a shot. The robot, which we called Pool Pal, then attempts to replicate that shot. At the end of the project, our robot could successfully pot pool balls at an impressive accuracy (see<a href='#video1'>Video 1</a>). I was responsible for designing, testing, and assembling the robotic system, which consisted of two main components: the gantry and the striking mechanism.",
      "Our design was well-received by the judges: out of 16 teams, we won the <b>Best Technical Skills Project award</b> and placed <b>second overall</b> at a university-hosted competition. Teamwork was critical to our success. With members collaborating across multiple systems, clear and consistent communication was essential. One example was calibrating the gantry system's sensors, which helped manage the loss of timing belt tension over time. Solving this problem required close collaboration between the electrical lead and me, as we combined our efforts to tackle the issue effectively."

The role sharpened my ability to multitask, communicate clearly, and stay calm under pressure.

      "Between 2015 and 2018, I took part in regional robotics competitions across Thailand, including the World Robotics Olympiad (<a href='https://wro-association.org/'>WRO</a>), which brings together students to solve LEGO Mindstorm challenges. The prompts ranged from building home appliance robots to tackling unpredictable terrain, pushing us to think creatively under pressure. These early years introduced me to the world of robotics: programming sensors, engineering moving parts, and the basics of robotic localisation. Our team won several regional prizes, and while we didn’t quite reach the international stage, the experience sparked a lasting passion for building and problem-solving.",
      "During my early robotics training, I began with block-based programming environments like LEGO Mindstorms NXT-G, which helped me grasp fundamental logic and control flow. As I took on more complex challenges, I transitioned to writing JavaScript scripts to directly control robot behaviour. A shift that gave me greater flexibility and precision. Learning JavaScript through robotics sparked my curiosity in applying it beyond physical machines, making the leap to web development feel natural. The language that once powered my robots soon became the tool I used to build interactive websites and creative digital experiences."

"Hello, my name is Oliver! I am a fourth-year student of BEng Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. With over eight years of experience in IT, both personally and academically, I'm eager to apply my skills in a real-world environment, learn from experienced engineers, and contribute to impactful projects. I'm a fast learner, naturally collaborative, and focused on delivering value wherever I can. My main interests lie in robotics and software systems design and development, areas where I’ve earned recognition and awards (see <a href='#image1'>Image 1</a> and <a href='#image2'>Image 2</a>).",
"This personal portfolio website was a personal project to reimagine site navigation through a fully interactive 3D solar system. Each planet acts as a portal to different sections of the portfolio. Built with Vite and Three.js, the project aims to showcase my web development skills, combined with a new area of technology for me in 3D modelling to create a visually engaging and unconventional user experience. The project showcases proficiency in JavaScript, modular design, event-driven interactions, and creative UI/UX thinking. I invite you to explore the GitHub repository for this project:<a href='https://github.com/popcorns41/solar-system-portfolio'target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a>to browse this project's inspiration and current development stage."
